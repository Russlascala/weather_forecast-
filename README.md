# weather_forecast-
This is a weather forecast site using open weather map api. I got the original code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFjxqzMTsBc. I fine tuned the wind direction because it was coming up with undefined for a north wind. I added a get weather by zip code (US only) function. I also added a google maps api.
